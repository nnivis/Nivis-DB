Hi there! My name is Yana. I'm a game developer from Russia. In fact, I really wanted to be a game developer when I was a teenager, but now I'm not so sure about that. However, I really enjoy development as a hobby. For example, right now, I'm working on my own project. I also like walking around the city with a cup of coffee and watching movies!

I started learning English in school, but it wasn't very successful. Now I really understand why I need it! I want to connect with people all over the world and learn a lot about other countries. Also, learning English can help me in my career as a game developer by allowing me to collaborate with international teams.

What about you? Why are you learning English?

Thank you for reading this letter! Have a nice day! ðŸ–¤
